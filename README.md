# About 

Netflix is a subscription based application which allows users to watch movies and shows for a monthly fee. The available content changes based on Netflix's ability to purchase and maintain the rights to said content. Netflix released a quarterly report on which movies and shows will be removed from their application, but there is not built-in service for users to see which movies and shows are being removed. 

With our application, users can create a watch list which is then compared to Netflix's upcoming content removal list. Users then see a countdown for how many days they have left before their movies or shows will no longer be available! 

# How It Works
